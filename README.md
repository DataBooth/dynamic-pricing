## Background

I submitted my Ph.D. thesis `Charged fluids near interfaces: Integral equation theory` in 1998.
As part of the submission I included some electronic resources at the following link (no https in those days!):

Alas the University of Sydney (School of Chemistry) didn't seem to prioritise the longevity of these materials (I did ask others if they had a copy of my `FORTRAN` code, however to date nothing has materialised.)
