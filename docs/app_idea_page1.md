### Background

Opportunity to introduce dynamic pricing into pharmacy and ways your team may be able to help me access and analyse data to create the algorithm. 

One of my old professors is a specialist in this area of research and his able to guide the process, but cannot spend the time actually developing it out - having an engineer (or team of engineers) to do this would be amazing.

### Dynamic Pricing

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pricing

Dynamic pricing, also referred to as surge pricing, demand pricing, or time-based pricing, is a pricing strategy in which businesses set flexible prices for products or services based on current market demands.[1] Businesses are able to change prices based on algorithms that take into account competitor pricing, supply and demand, and other external factors in the market.[2] Dynamic pricing is a common practice in several industries such as hospitality, tourism, entertainment, retail, electricity, and public transport. Each industry takes a slightly different approach to dynamic pricing based on its individual needs and the demand for the product.
