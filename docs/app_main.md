This thesis examines the structure of two charged liquids, water and molten
potassium chloride, near charged, planar interfaces. 

First, following a systematic approximation to an expansion of the entropy, within the grand canonical ensemble, functional optimization of the grand potential is used to derive closed sets of integral equations. These describe, approximately, the structure and thermodynamics of both homogeneous and inhomogeneous fluids. Connections with existing integral equation approximations
in the literature, and a compact derivation of the anisotropic hypernetted chain (AHNC)
approximation are presented. Selected new equation sets are highlighted.

Second, results from the numerical solution of a singlet integral equation approximation are reported, which describe the structure and properties of (i) an atom-based model of water, and (ii) molten potassium chloride, next to a planar interface.
Predictions from the theory include the density and charge profiles perpendicular to
the interface, the mean electrostatic potential, the potential of zero charge and the
differential capacitance. The results of this work are compared with the output from
computer simulations.

Lastly, the Newton-GMRES algorithm is introduced for the accurate, robust
and efficient solution of such Ornstein-Zernike type integral equations. This method is
compared and contrasted with more traditional approaches in the literature, using Picard
iteration, hybrid Newton-Raphson/Picard methods, and a vector extrapolation method.
The performance and ease of implementation of these nonlinear solvers recommend them
for the solution of this class of problem.
