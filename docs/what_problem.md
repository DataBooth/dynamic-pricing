## Charged Fluids Near Interfaces

### What problem does this thesis address?

Consider for a moment one litre of water, at room temperature and atmospheric
pressure. The density of liquid water is close to 1.0 gram per cubic centimetre, or
equivalently 55.5 moles per cubic decimetre, at these conditions. Suppose now that
we place this litre of water into a cubic container with sides of length 10 centimeters.
There would be around 300 million "layers" of water molecules between the walls of this
container.

The structure of a model of water at a perfectly flat, charged or uncharged,
interface is one of the topics considered in this thesis. For example, some of the structural
quantities calculated in this work are:
1. the normalized oxygen and hydrogen density profiles, $g_{wO}(z)$ and $g_{wH}(z)$, which are displayed in the upper panel of Figure 1.1 of the thesis hard-copy; and
2. the mean electrostatic potential (z) (lower panel of Figure 1.1). 

As will be seen
later, this study predicts that the presence of the surface disrupts the structure of water
to about a "depth" of only four layers of water molecules!

On first inspection, it might thus appear that a more comprehensive understanding of the arrangement of water molecules near such boundaries is unimportant or even
irrelevant. On the contrary, many authors have pointed out that a detailed knowledge
of the structure of water near an interface is essential to our basic understanding of
phenomena which arise in the chemistry of biological, colloidal, electrochemical, and
geological systems.

A comprehensive theoretical description of the equilibrium properties of charged
liquids near surfaces has inspired many research efforts since the pioneering works of
Helmholtz, Gouy, Chapman and Stern. The idealized notion of the so-called
electrical double layer, first attributed to Helmholtz, still (somewhat unfortunately)
permeates the language of "modern-day" electrochemistry. By far the most popular
studies of the electrical double layer, both experimental and theoretical, have been
concerned with aqueous electrolyte solutions. Indeed the author has made such an
investigation.

However, in contrast, two other types of charged fluids at electrified interfaces
are considered here: liquid water at 25 Â°C; and molten potassium chloride just above
its melting point. The primary aim of this thesis is to provide further insight into the
nanoscopic structure of these charged liquids, near both charged and uncharged interfaces.
