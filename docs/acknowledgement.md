### Bulk solution inputs

This project uses the solutions for the Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) equation, usually with the HNC closure.
They are obtained using the `pyOZ` package, an iterative solver of the Ornstein-Zernike equation, by Lubos Vrbka.

#### Proverbs 3:5-10

_Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil. It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine._
