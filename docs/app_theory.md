### Theory for the interface

To predict the normalized probability $g_{wi}(z)$ for finding an oxygen ($i$ = O) or
hydrogen ($i$ = H) atom of a water molecule at a distance $z$ perpendicular to the
planar interface ("wall"), we use the "singlet" theory version of the Ornstein-Zernike
equation due to Henderson, Abraham and Barker and Percus
together with the approximate hypernetted chain (HNC) closure. We have also used this level of theory to study soft-core primitive model electrolytes and molten salts next to charged interfaces.

The input to the calculation is:

i. the structure of the bulk model water, as contained in the direct correlation
functions $c_{ij}(r)$, for all distinct pairs of species, $ij$ = OO, OH and HH, separated
by a distance $r$;

ii. the bulk water density $\bar{\rho}$ and temperature $T$;

iii. the short-range potential energy between the wall and the oxygen and hydrogen
atoms, $\phi_{wi}(z)$, $i$ = O, H; and

iv. either the surface potential $\psi_0$ or surface charge density $\sigma$.

#### CF1 model of liquid water

In this thesis we use the CF1 model of water. This model is a slight variant
of the central force (CF) model of Stillinger and Rahman, which allows the water
molecules to vibrate and even dissociate. Central force models view water as a
"molten salt" of two fractionally charged species, hydrogen and oxygen, with effective
charges $q_H = 0.32983 e$ and $q_O
= -2 q_H$, where $e$ is the proton charge. The current
method may be applied to any model of water with a unified Hamiltonian for intra- and
inter-molecular degrees of freedom.
