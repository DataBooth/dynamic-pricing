### Theory for the interface

To predict the normalized probability $g_wi(z)$ for finding an oxygen ($i$ = O) or
hydrogen ($i$ = H) atom of a water molecule at a distance $z$ perpendicular to the
planar interface ("wall"), we use the "singlet" theory version of the Ornstein-Zernike
equation due to Henderson, Abraham and Barker
<!-- 39,94,95  -->
and Percus
<!-- 96 --> together with the
approximate hypernetted chain (HNC) closure. We have also used this level of theory
to study soft-core primitive model electrolytes7,97 and molten salts (Chapter 4 of this
thesis) next to charged interfaces.

The input to the calculation is:
i. the structure of the bulk model water, as contained in the direct correlation
functions cij(r), for all distinct pairs of species, ij = 00, OH and HH, separated
by a distance $r$;
ii. the bulk water density p and temperature T;
iii. the short-range potential energy between the wall and the oxygen and hydrogen
atoms, Qwi(2), i = O, H; and
iv. either the surface potential yo or surface charge density o.

#### CF1 model of liquid water

In this thesis we use the CF1 model of water. This model is a slight variant
of the central force (CF) model of Stillinger and Rahman,98 which allows the water
molecules to vibrate and even dissociate.99,100 Central force models view water as a
"molten salt" of two fractionally charged species, hydrogen and oxygen, with effective
charges qH = 0.32983 e and go
= - 29H, where e is the proton charge. The current
method may be applied to any model of water with a unified Hamiltonian for intra-and
