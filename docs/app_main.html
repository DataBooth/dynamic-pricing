These describe, approximately, the structure and thermodynamics of both homogeneous and inhomogeneous fluids. Connections with existing integral equation approximations\n', 'in the literature, and a compact derivation of the anisotropic hypernetted chain (AHNC)\n', 'approximation are presented. Selected new equation sets are highlighted.\n', '\n', 'Second, results from the numerical solution of a singlet integral equation approximation are reported, which describe the structure and properties of (i) an atom-based model of water, and (ii) molten potassium chloride, next to a planar interface.\n', 'Predictions from the theory include the density and charge profiles perpendicular to\n', 'the interface, the mean electrostatic potential, the potential of zero charge and the\n', 'differential capacitance. The results of this work are compared with the output from\n', 'computer simulations.\n', '\n', 'Lastly, the Newton-GMRES algorithm is introduced for the accurate, robust\n', 'and efficient solution of such Ornstein-Zernike type integral equations. This method is\n', 'compared and contrasted with more traditional approaches in the literature, using Picard\n', 'iteration, hybrid Newton-Raphson/Picard methods, and a vector extrapolation method.\n', 'The performance and ease of implementation of these nonlinear solvers recommend them\n', 'for the solution of this class of problem.'</p>
